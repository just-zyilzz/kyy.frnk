# Walkthrough - Paper Texture Addition

I have added a vintage paper texture to the "Untuk Kamu" message card to enhance the aesthetic as requested.

## Changes

### Assets
- Generated `paper_texture.png` and placed it in the project directory.

### CSS
- Updated `.message-card` in [style.css](file:///c:/Users/USER/Documents/justkyy/style.css) to use the paper texture background.
- Adjusted text colors in `.letter-content` and `.signature` to be darker for better contrast against the light paper background.
- Added a slight rotation and shadow to the card for a realistic paper look.

## Verification Results

### Automated Checks
- Verified [style.css](file:///c:/Users/USER/Documents/justkyy/style.css) syntax and structure.

### Manual Verification
- [x] The message card now has a paper texture background.
- [x] Text is readable (dark on light).
- [x] The card has a subtle rotation and shadow.
